  "peril_desert": "Desolation",
  "peril_desert_context": "An immense and tawny furnace barely contained by its horizons. At night, a chilly wilderness of stars. We must go carefully, with Forge to shape our way or Grail to secure us against thirst.",
  "peril_forest": "Peril-Prowled Forest",
  "peril_forest_context": "Long ago, the primal trees marched from sea to sea. Some traces of their reign still survive - like this dense and choking territory of root and thorn. The practicalities of Forge, or the mysteries of Moth, may see us through.",
  "peril_mountains": "The High Passes",

  "vaultcapital4": "St Agnes Hospital",
  "vaultcapital4_context": "They did good work here, once. Certainly there were a few too many amputations, but then there are individuals one would prefer not to walk the city streets.",
  "vaultcapital5": "Congregation of St Felix of Sch√ºren",
  "vaultcapital5_context": "A Nonconformist enclave of a heterodox sect of a Calvinist offshoot, tucked away in an odd corner of the city. They belt out hymns with unsuitable gusto, in a throat-scraping language that is very much not quite Latin.",
  "vaultcapitaldefault": "The Forsaken Reach",
  "vaultcapitaldefault_context": "Along the grey banks of the rotting river, the warehouses wait. Perhaps I have identified one where an unusual cargo was stored. [You've found all the Expeditions in the Capital, although you can find and visit the Reach several times.]",
  "vaultshires1": "Gladwyn Lake",
  "vaultshires1_context": "Beneath the stark slopes of the fells, the mist-wreathed surface of the lake waits. There was a twin altar here before the Romans came; and a legend of a serpent who was sent to defile that altar.",
  "vaultshires2": "Lockwood Fen",

  "vaultshiresdefault_context": "Drive through the downs to the coast where the grey-green land meets Atlantic grey. Search along the road for signs to Kerisham town.

  "vaultcontinent1": "Chateau Raveline",
  "vaultcontinent1_context": "The favourite stories of the Comtes des Raveline claim they descend from the first Sun-King. Other stories have them prowling the forest in wolf-shape. They are long gone. Their rotting chateau remains. Not all its malignities have been uncovered.",
  "vaultcontinent2": "Fermier Abbey",
  "vaultcontinent2_context": "Robert Fermier spent much of his unsavoury fortune on the endowment of this monumental, forest-crowded abbey. The monks dislike visitors. Their ways are not exactly orthodox. They celebrate a certain harvest festival with unsavoury vigour.",
  "vaultcontinent3": "Orthos Wood",
  "vaultcontinent3_context": "The pines grow thick as hairs on a dog's back. The airs of the inner wood are chokingly thick with resin and dust. The source that brought you here claimed that in the dawn times, the greatest tree, at the wood's black heart, served as perch for a great masked Crow.",
  "vaultcontinent4": "The Vanderschaaf Collection",
  "vaultcontinent4_context": "A cramped little museum in a provincial town, long closed to the public since an outbreak of peculiar rapture in the room where they keep the pressed flowers.

  "vaultcontinent5": "Forman House",
  "vaultcontinent5_context": "Filip Forman, the helminthologist and antiquarian, did all his best work here at the family home, until the day his subjects escaped. The infestation was destroyed, but Forman, they say, walks the halls to this day, guarding his library and his shame.",
  "vaultcontinent6": "Key-Hunter's Garret",
  "vaultcontinent6_context": "Vienna is one of those few cities which has the same name in every History, although adepts know it as the White City, or perhaps the City of the White. In a snowy street, in a crooked house, in a high and rattling attic, we have learnt that an eccentric hunter of imaginary keys has established a tiny trove of odd books.",
  "vaultcontinentdefault": "The Unnumbered Stones",
  "vaultcontinentdefault_context": "Megaliths placed in obsessive, inerrant rows by priest-castes long dead. Time has long erased the original blood-stains, but on moonless nights, the locals supplement what remains. Hidden chambers might guard hidden treasures. [You've found all the Expeditions on the Continent, although you can find and visit the Stones several times.]",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest1": "Cave of Candles",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest1_context": "Every seventh sunset, the cunning man comes from the village below to renew the candles. The floor of the entrance chamber is a slick of stinking wax. He claims the light keeps the creature below cowed; but more likely the sacrifices he brings keep it too sated to emerge.",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest2": "Voivode's Citadel",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest2_context": "In the days of the great power of the Turks, a man of power ruled here. Over many years he fed many thirsts, until his own thirst overcame him. I have learned that both his treasures, and his victims, may remain in an untouched vault below the castle.",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest3": "Grunewald's Permanent Circus",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest3_context": "A tiny city of patched tents around a white-washed farm. Hunched performers shiver in the dripping rain. Frau Grunewald has devoted her considerable fortune to the maintenance of this institution: who knows why? The circus performers dislike trespassers behind the scenes.",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest4": "Tower Revek",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest4_context": "The blasted stump of a building. The air festers. Whatever power destroyed this place still clings. Only one floor remains above ground, but we suspect more space below.",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest5": "The Kusnetsov Endowment",
  "vaultlandbeyondforest5_context": "Prince Kusnetsov gave one fourth part of his blood-soaked fortune to the establishment of a Department for Eschatology at this provincial university. The staff have grown peculiar, now, and the buildings fester in a freezing swamp, but some of Kusnetsov's bequest, perhaps, was spent on treasures.",
  "vaultlandbeyondforestdefault": "Foxlily Meadows",
  "vaultlandbeyondforestdefault_context": "The scent of foxlilies inspires ferocious appetites. It is probably fortunate that they grow only at this altitude. The peasants have organised to keep treasure-seekers away, but some treasure-seekers fall prey to lily-hungers. Their own treasures lie among their bones; and so the cycle continues. [You've found all the Expeditions in the Land Beyond the Forest, although you can find and visit the Meadows several times.]",
  "vaultrendingmountains1": "Hunter's Pits",
  "vaultrendingmountains1_context": "The Tearing Tribes enlarged this cave system, digging shafts, preparing traps. It may have been a place of execution, or a proving ground. In either case it's sacred, and the tribes don't want us here. If we survive them, there is still one more terror in the cramped tunnels.",
  "vaultrendingmountains2": "Snow's Keeper",
  "vaultrendingmountains2_context": "A mountain-peak temple of ill-omened aspect. Jewel-bright fungus-slicks glow in the snow. None has come here in a generation, but still something moves within.",
  "vaultrendingmountains3": "The Eye of Ikirmawi",
  "vaultrendingmountains3_context": "We have read of a sultan who, eight hundred years ago could sleep only beneath the stars. He ordered the construction of this observatory, so that the stars could be accurately depicted on the ceiling of his bedchamber. Regrettably, the stars they saw were not safe for the unprotected human mind. The sultan's successor ordered the observatory sealed.",
  "vaultrendingmountains4": "Mausoleum of Wolves",
  "vaultrendingmountains4_context": "This chilly monument was built long before Rome fell. Stone wolves watch the door. A chamber within was carved from rock, to await fragments of the Sun at its prophesied funeral procession. That procession never came, but still the Dead are drawn here.",
  "vaultrendingmountainsdefault": "Tombs of the Shadowless Kings",
  "vaultrendingmountainsdefault_context": "In a rearing outcrop of lion-coloured rock, labourers carved tombs for the first kings of this land. Those kings had hoped to be immortal, and perhaps one of them is. The others lie among their trinkets. A hereditary order of guardians watches closely. [You've found all the Expeditions in the Rending Mountains, although you can find and visit the Tombs several times.]",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands1": "Star-Shattered Fane",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands1_context": "Here was a place sacred to the gods of earth, until a meteor fell on a winter's night. In time, worshippers crept back to the broken ruins. In time, the meteorite itself came to be worshipped as a bringer of dreams. The old altar may yet remain, somewhere beneath the meteorite's lair.",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands2": "Lagun's Tomb",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands2_context": "A low slope-sided rectangle of mud brick, in an obscure fold of the desert. It is not remarkable to look at, but Lagun was counted among the immortal Long, and no robber has ever breached his tomb.",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands3": "Messana",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands3_context": "A quietly prosperous village rests in the crook of the river: a surprising splash of green against the dusty land behind. The longevity of the villagers surpasses the natural. What are they hiding?",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands4": "Temple of Seven Coils",
  "vaultloneandlevelsands4_context": "A crumbling temple in a shadowed defile. It was built, it seems, in the Third History, the one where much later the Worms overran Europe, but it exists in all the Histories now.",
  "vaultloneandlevelsandsdefault": "Miah",
  "vaultloneandlevelsandsdefault_context": "There was a city here. We can pick over its remains like jackals over old bones: palace walls, buried roads, shattered fountains. Sometimes we may find the knowledge of the dead, and sometimes the dead may find us. [You've found all the Expeditions in the Sands, although you can find and visit Miah several times.]",
  "vaulteveningisles1": "Raven Isle",
  "vaulteveningisles1_context": "An extinct volcano lifts its head from a fervid tangle of emerald jungle. Immortals fallen to the vilest crime of their kind are exiled here to roost, guzzling the blood and cracking the bones of unwary travellers. They must have acquired some interesting toys over the years.",
  "vaulteveningisles2": "Fort Geryk",
  "vaulteveningisles2_context": "Three hundred years ago, a rapacious empire claimed an island ripe with tourmalines. Neither the empire nor the island are mentioned in any reputable history. But the governor's fortress remains. Perhaps his treasures remain. For that matter, perhaps he does, too.",
  "vaulteveningisles3": "The Wreck of the Christabel",
  "vaulteveningisles3_context": "A sea-beast came to love this vessel, but when she would not return its affections, the sea-beast crushed it. Even now, the beast will not leave the ship's corpse, bedecked as it is with occult treasures. We must dive carefully.",
  "vaulteveningisles4": "St Tentreto of the Deep Door",
  "vaulteveningisles4_context": "A monastery hangs grimly to a cliff-edge. It should have fallen into the sea by now, but - we have read - the monks drown victims in a deep pool beneath, to win the Sister-and-Witch's protection from the sea, one more year, one more year.",
  "vaulteveningislesdefault": "Port Noon",
  "vaulteveningislesdefault_context": "There is a choice that every immortal must make: enter the service of an Hour, or return to the mortal ranks, or face extinction. The sunny little island-port called Noon is the exile-realm of the immortals who refused all those options. [You've found all the Expeditions in the Evening Isles, although you can find and visit Noon several times.]",
  "vaultfloating1": "The 'Hebe Stanton'",
  "vaultfloating1_context": "A battered but surprisingly plush steamer, much used by actors fleeing scandal, by shy millionaires, by occult scholars who feel safer with moving water under them; and, just once, by the Ligeia Club, who chartered the whole ship for the use of seven cabins."
